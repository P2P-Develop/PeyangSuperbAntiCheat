# PSAC contribution rules

まぁまぁ真面目な日本語が欲しいなら[ここ](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)へ、どうぞ。

## Overview

PSAC has established some rules to properly contribute as a PSAC contributor.   

### Issue, Pull Request manners

- Try to minimize duplicate issue.  
  The duplicate issue has a \[duplicate\] label and a reference to the issue, so if you notice it, close it.
- When asking questions in Issue, keep in mind **smart questions**.  
  Please use the \[question\] label when asking a question.
- Please create a pull request from the **forked branch**.  
  PSAC has only two branches, "master" and "dev".
- **Be sure to select the dev branch as the basis for your pull request. **  
  The master branch holds only the source code that is stable at the time of release.
- Try to use pull requests and publishing templates as much as possible.  

### Commit manners

- Do not use strange commit names except in **docs**.
- If you have a GPG key, feel free to sign it.
- If you can check it, compile it to see if it works and then commit.  
  If you are not sure and the workflow also fails, commit the fixed changes.
  **Note: Do not make significant changes in a commit commit.**
